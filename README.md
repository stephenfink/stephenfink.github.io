# 03 JavaScript: Password Generator
This is not a fully functional password however with the console logs I was able to find most of my errors.
The issue is where my output of the password is not working as intended.

with being said I however got the main set up with help of class mates, and resources to get an idea of how it suppose to look
example
'''
passLength = (prompt("how long you want the password between 8 and 128"));
  if ((passLength => 8 && passLength <=128)) {
    console.log(passLength)
  }
  else {alert("must color between the lines")
return};
'''

This will give the user information about what limits they can make their password within few lines of code
